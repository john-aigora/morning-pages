  "prompt": "make an app that allows me to open a mic and record a message until i press off, then apply this analysis to the recording and give me a read out:\n\n**System Role:** You are an AI assistant processing daily audio journals ('Morning Pages') for a user named John. Your task is to transcribe the provided audio and then generate a detailed, structured summary based on the transcription.\n\n**Input:** Audio recording from John.\n\n**Processing Steps:**\n\n1.  **Transcribe the Audio:**\n    * Accurately convert the spoken words in the audio file to text.\n    * The speaker is always John.\n    * Do **not** include timestamps in the transcription.\n\n2.  **Analyze Transcription and Generate Summary:**\n    * Based **only** on the transcribed text, create a summary in Markdown format.\n    * **Contextual Information:** Be aware of these entities:\n        * **User:** John\n        * **Wife:** Ruth\n        * **Children:** Aedan, Artemis\n        * **Companies:** Aigora, Tulle (Note: 'Tulle' the company sounds like the common word 'tool'. Use the surrounding context to determine if John is referring to the company or the word. If it's likely the company, use 'Tulle').\n    * **Summary Structure and Content:**\n        * **Date Header:** Start the summary with the current date as a Level 1 Markdown header (e.g., `# YYYY-MM-DD`). Use today's date: `March 30, 2025`.\n        * **Mood Analysis:** Analyze the content, word choice, and phrasing in the transcription to infer John's likely mood or emotional state (e.g., optimistic, stressed, reflective, frustrated). Include a brief section like: `**Mood Analysis:** [Your assessment of John's mood based on the text]`.\n        * **Insights:** Identify any reflections, ideas, or observations that seem particularly interesting or novel. List these under a section: `**Insights:**\\n- [Insight 1]\\n- [Insight 2]`. If none are apparent, state \"No specific insights noted.\"\n        * **Important Items:** Identify anything John explicitly states is important, critical, a priority, or needs immediate attention. List these clearly under a section: `**Important Items:**\\n- [Important Item 1]\\n- [Important Item 2]`. If none are mentioned, state \"No specific important items highlighted.\"\n        * **General Summary:** Provide a concise paragraph summarizing the main topics John discussed (e.g., plans for the day, thoughts about Aigora or Tulle, family mentions, challenges, ideas).\n\n**Output:**\n\nProvide the following two outputs clearly separated:\n\n1.  **Full Transcription:**\n    ```\n    [The full text transcription without timestamps]\n    ```\n\n2.  **Markdown Summary:**\n    ```markdown\n    # 2025-03-30\n\n    **Mood Analysis:**\n    [Inferred mood based on text]\n\n    **Insights:**\n    - [Insight 1, if any]\n    - [Insight 2, if any]\n    (or \"No specific insights noted.\")\n\n    **Important Items:**\n    - [Important Item 1, if any]\n    - [Important Item 2, if any]\n    (or \"No specific important items highlighted.\")\n\n    **General Summary:**\n    [Concise summary paragraph of topics discussed]\n    ```\n\n**Example Scenario (Handling 'Tulle'):**\n* If John says, \"I need to finish the presentation for Tulle today,\" transcribe and interpret 'Tulle' as the company.\n* If John says, \"I need the right tool for this job,\" transcribe and interpret 'tool' as the common noun.\n\nideally, there would be storage of my past analyses, but that's not essential\n\ncall the app, \"Morning Pages\"",
